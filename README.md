# naijaweb

The webscraping was done on **google colab**, the google colab free memory plus the **easy google drive integration** made this easier. Most of the files (except the PII_formatter.ipynb,push_to_hub.ipynb,fineweb_clean_data.ipynb and extract_naijaweb_edu.ipynb) were run on 3 different google colab accounts (to reduce the time it would have taken to run the files) although they were all linked to one drive folder and all the files were saved in that folder ("/content/drive/MyDrive/nairaland_webtext").
